# Digraph of model
Digraph of Deep Learning model

## Overview
In order to help us increase the model's performance in our works, we often use various kind tools on models. The digraph of model is one of the kind. Next, I would show digraph of models on VGG16 and ResNet50. One thing to be aware of is that we execute this method on the **Pytorch**, Maybe we will execute the method on **Tensorflow** at future.


## Theory
Digraph of model is use record gradient 

## Installation
### Ubuntu
Anaconda environment (recommended)
```
git clone 

# Create a environment for neural networks.
# The First is create a environment of anaconda.
conda create -n Digraph python=3.7
conda activate Digraph

# Second, we should installed dependency package.
pip install 
```
