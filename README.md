# Model visualization

## Overview
In order to help us increase the model's performance in our works, we often use various kind tools on models. The visualization of model is one of the kind. Next, I would show visualization of models on VGG16 and ResNet50. One thing to be aware of is that we execute this method on the **Pytorch**, Maybe we will execute the method on **Tensorflow** at future, and You can pay close attention with this project.


## Installation
### Ubuntu
Anaconda environment (recommended)
```
git clone https://github.com/YiCheno/model-visualization.git

# Create a environment for neural networks.
# The First is create a environment of anaconda.
conda create -n env python=3.7
conda activate env

# Second, we should installed dependency package.
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
